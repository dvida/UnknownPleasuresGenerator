# Unknown Pleasures Generator
A Python script that randomly generates a graph similar to the one on the cover of the album Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division. The original cover was based on an image of radio waves from pulsar CP 1919, from The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy.
Parameters of image generation can be changed to your preference.
